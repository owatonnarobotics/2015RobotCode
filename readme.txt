Go to your wpilib folder,into the java folder, then current, then lib, and then copy the "WPILib.jar" file.
Go to the 2015RobotCode, create a "lib" folder, and paste the file you copied into that"lib" folder.
Open Eclipse, click file, click new, and then click Java Project.
Uncheck the "Use Default Location" box, select the "2015RobotCode" file, and click finish.
If you still get hundreds of errors, then in Eclipse's project explorer, right-click on "WPILib.jar" and click "Add to Bulid Path".
Now, buckle down, and start coding!
